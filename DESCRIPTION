Description: Msgpack is a binary data format similar to JSON, useful
             for storing, transmitting, and interchanging structured
             data. There are implementations of msgpack for many
             popular programming languages. Compared to JSON, msgpack
             uses fewer bytes and is faster to encode and decode. The
             msgpackr package encodes and decodes msgpack messages,
             from static data and from sockets and streams.
