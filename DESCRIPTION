Description: A fast C-based encoder and decoder for msgpack data format.
             Msgpack is a binary data format, similar in structure to
             JSON, useful for storing, transmitting, and exchanging structured
             data. There are implementations of msgpack for many
             popular programming languages. Compared to JSON, msgpack
             uses fewer bytes and is faster to encode and decode. This package
             translates between msgpack format and R data structures.
