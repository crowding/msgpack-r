\title{Encode R data structures in bytes using msgpack.}
\usage{
packb(x, compatible = FALSE, as_is = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An R object, which can be a vectors, lists, environments,
and combinations thereof.}

\item{compatible}{If TRUE, emitted bytes conform to version 1.0 of
msgpack encoding. This means that msgpack strings are used for
raw objects.}

\item{warn}{Whether to emit warnings.}

\item{as.is}{If TRUE, vectors of length 1 having no names attribute
are encoded as msgpack arrays of length 1. Otherwise singleton
vectors are simplified to msgpack scalars.}

\item{use.dicts}{if TRUE, vectors having a "names" attribute}

\item{x}{An R object.}
}
\value{
An object of class "raw".

Strings are always emitted in UTF-8. Integral floating-point values
may be emitted as integers to save space.

A hook for pre-processing R objects before packing is supported
as follows: Set the class attribute of an object to \code{c("prepack", "myclass")}, then provide an S3 method for \code{encode.myclass} that
transforms the object.
