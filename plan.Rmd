Plan of action:

    * make the unpack underflow handler fire.
    * make both `cw_unpack_context` and `unpack_opts_struct` into
      one external pointer object, allocated in the opts() call (and filled out in the init() call)?
      * Make it maintain state across read calls, even.
      * Make sure you remember up to beginning of most recent partial message at R level.
      * And the same with the writer? So as to write one buffer at a time?
